* Aspeed Static Memory controller
* Aspeed SPI Flash Controller

The Static memory controller in the ast2400 supports 5 chip selects each
can be attached to NAND, parallel NOR, or SPI NOR attached flash.  The
Firmware Memory Controller in the ast2500 supports 3 chip selects, two of
which are always in SPI-NOR mode and the third can be SPI-NOR or parallel
flash.  The SPI flash controller in the ast2400 supports one of 2 chip
selects selected by pinmux.  The two SPI flash controllers in the ast2500
each support two chip selects.

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be one of
	"aspeed,ast2400-fmc" for the AST2400 Static Memory Controller
	"aspeed,ast2400-smc" for the AST2400 SPI Flash Controller
	"aspeed,ast2500-fmc" for the AST2500 Firmware SPI Memory Controller
	"aspeed,ast2500-smc" for the AST2500 SPI Flash Controllers
  - reg : the first contains the control register location and length,
          the second contains the memory window mapping address and length
  - clocks : The APB clock input to the controller
  - #address-cells : must be 1 corresponding to chip select child binding
  - #size-cells : must be 0 corresponding to chip select child binding

Optional properties:
  - aspeed,fmc-has-dma : controller supports DMA transfers
  - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the dma device if an fmc

Child node required properties:
  - reg : must contain chip select number in first cell of address, must
	  be 1 tuple long
  - compatible : may contain "vendor,part", must include "jedec,spi-nor"
		when attached to SPI flash (see spi-nor.txt binding).

Child node optional properties:
  - label           - (optional) name to assign to mtd, default os assigned

Child node optional properties for SPI mode (may be ignored):
  - spi-max-frequency - (optional) max frequency of spi bus
  - spi-cpol        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
			inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode (boolean)
  - spi-cpha        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
			shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode (boolean)
  - spi-tx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                        used for MOSI. Defaults to 1 if not present.
  - spi-rx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                        used for MOSI. Defaults to 1 if not present.

Grandchild node optional properties:
 - see mtd/partiton.txt for partitioning bindings and mtd naming

	compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-fmc";
	reg = < 0x1e620000 0x94

	flash@0 {

		boot@0 {

		image@8000 {
			label = "kernel-image";
			reg = < 0x8000 0x1f8000 >
		}
	};
	flash@1 {
		reg = < 1 >;
		compatible = "jedec,spi-nor" ;
		label = "alt";
		/* spi-max-frequency = <>; */
		status = "fail";
		/* m25p,fast-read; */
	};
